# Next

Set offsets (Italian herbs and cheese top, sauce, peppers)

Menu -> Ingredient

Completely separate bread bottom and bread top. Only bread bottom has its nutrition facts. Bread top is just for "Done" display.

# Todo

- Make the background color of the bread images pure white

- Window resize event

- Total nutrition facts -> background: half-transparent white, some blur

- If ingredientData's structure becomes like following,

```javascript
bread: [
  {
    name: 'italian_herbs_and_cheese',
    selected: false,
    ...
  }
]
```

  then I no longer have to convert camel to snake or vice versa

- Change the values of the nutrition balloon when breadSize is hovered
